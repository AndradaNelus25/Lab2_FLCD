# Lab2_FLCD

For this lab we had to create a lexical scanner, which has as output the Symbol table and the PIF. My solution has 4 functions (integer_check(), reservedWord_check(), separator_check() and identifier_check()) which check if the words that we find in the input file are integers, reserved words, separators or identifiers (tokens). Also, I have 3 "tables" : Symbol Table, Tokens Table and the Program Internal Form. In the main() function we store those three "tables" using HashMaps. For the ST and TT we have the key - a string ; the value - an integer and for the PIF the value will be a list of integers. We put in the TT the tokens and give each of them an assigned value. After this, we read from the file that we have our program in line by line, taking into consideration that the words are split by space. Taking each word in the file, we first check if it is an integer or an identifier. In case it is, we check if it already appears in the TT and in the ST and in case it is not, we add it. Then, to populate the PIF, we check if it is a token (in case it is not we display an error and don't add it to the table) and create the list of positions in PIF. If it is an identifier we add a 0, if it is an integer we add 1 and if it is another token we add -1 (as the ST only contains identifiers and constants). Then we add the corresponding TT value to the list. In the end, we add to the PIF the code and position.
